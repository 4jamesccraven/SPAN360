Abstract
--------
Plan is to take old Spanish data encompassing a wide range of dates and
prepare it for use as a dataset to create a translator that translates
from Old Spanish to Modern Spanish for scholarly use.

Planned Steps
-------------
1. Get data from various sources
    1. Hispanic Seminary
2. Clean data
    1. Remove manuscript annotations
    2. Disambiguate where possible
3. Classify data
    1. Automated/probabilistic annotation models?
    2. POS tagging
    3. Lemmatization
    4. etc.
4. Wishful thinking: Translator
    1. Gather Modern Spanish translations
    2. Look into models (RNN, AutoEncoders, etc.)
    3. Train

Output
------
- Poster/Presentation of findings
- GitHub with code and potentially models if applicable
